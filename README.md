## The Technology

One of the strengths of GraphQL is [enforcing data types on runtime](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Value-Completion). Further, TypeScript and [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) (graphql-codegen) make it safer by typing data statically, so you can write truly type-protected code with rich IDE assists.
